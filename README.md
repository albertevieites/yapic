**yapic** is a photo-sharing community which helps users connect based on the type of photos they upload (tags) and their similar interests (shortlist). When users start to upload photos and create a collection, the app will match them with potential new friends based on their common likes. They will have the possibility to see their user match profiles and get in touch through a form (sender username and email is shared in submit).
